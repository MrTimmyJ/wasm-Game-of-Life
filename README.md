# Conway's game of life
Made in Rust using Web Assembly.

Author: Timothy Johnson <br>
Date: May 13 2024 to June 3 2024

## Overview

A performant, multithreaded implementation of Conway’s Game of Life using Rust and WebAssembly.
This interactive cellular automaton runs directly in the browser, leveraging Rust’s memory safety and WebAssembly's execution speed to deliver a responsive simulation rendered in HTML/JavaScript.

This project simulates Conway's Game of Life with a focus on performance, modularity, and WebAssembly integration. Written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, it offers a fast and memory-safe runtime with multithreaded simulation logic.

Useful as an educational tool, playground for WebAssembly + Rust experiments, or foundation for more complex simulations.

🧩 Features

    ♻️ Multithreaded Update Logic: Uses native Rust threads to parallelize universe state updates

    🕸️ WebAssembly Integration: Compiles to .wasm for browser execution

    ◼️ ASCII Output for Debugging: Simple visual feedback of simulation state

    🧮 Cell Toggle Logic: Click to activate/deactivate individual cells (JS-side integration)

    ⏱️ Performance Profiling: Custom Timer struct logs execution times to the browser console

    💻 Cross-Platform: Runs on any browser with WebAssembly support

🔄 User Workflow

    Launch the web application (or serve locally)

    Watch Conway’s Game of Life evolve with real-time updates

    Click cells to toggle state

    Pause game state to stop game

    Modify update rules or grid size via Rust and recompile

⚙️ How It Works
🧱 Grid Model

    The universe is stored as a 1D Vec<Cell> with calculated 2D indexing

    Cells are either Alive or Dead (enum)

    Grid dimensions are defined by width and height

🚦 State Transitions

    On each tick, the simulation calculates the number of living neighbors

    Rules follow Conway’s original logic:

        Any live cell with 2–3 live neighbors survives

        Dead cells with exactly 3 live neighbors become alive

🧵 Multithreaded Updates

    The universe is divided into horizontal slices

    Each slice is processed in a separate thread using std::thread

    Slices are merged at the end to form the next universe state

⏱️ Performance Logging

    A Timer struct wraps execution steps

    Execution time is logged via web_sys::console::time() and .time_end()
